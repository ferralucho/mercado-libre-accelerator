Pointers

Go has pointers. A pointer holds the memory address of a value.

The type *T is a pointer to a T value. Its zero value is nil.

var p *int

The & operator generates a pointer to its operand.

i := 42
p = &i

The * operator denotes the pointer's underlying value.

fmt.Println(*p) // read i through the pointer p
*p = 21         // set i through the pointer p

//Structs

	Y int
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{1, 2}
	p := &v
	p.X = 1e9
	fmt.Println(v)
}


//struct literals

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y int
}

var (
	v1 = Vertex{1, 2}  // has type Vertex
	v2 = Vertex{X: 1}  // Y:0 is implicit
	v3 = Vertex{}      // X:0 and Y:0
	p  = &Vertex{1, 2} // has type *Vertex
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(v1, p, v2, v3)
}


//arrays

func main() {
	var a [2]string
	a[0] = "Hello"
	a[1] = "World"
	fmt.Println(a[0], a[1])
	fmt.Println(a)

	primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
	fmt.Println(primes)
}

/*Slices

An array has a fixed size. A slice, on the other hand, is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array. In practice, slices are much more common than arrays.

The type []T is a slice with elements of type T.

A slice is formed by specifying two indices, a low and high bound, separated by a colon:

a[low : high]

This selects a half-open range which includes the first element, but excludes the last one.

The following expression creates a slice which includes elements 1 through 3 of a:

a[1:4]*/


func main() {
	primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}

	var s []int = primes[1:4]
	fmt.Println(s)
}


/*Slices are like references to arrays
A slice does not store any data, it just describes a section of an underlying array.
Changing the elements of a slice modifies the corresponding elements of its underlying array.
Other slices that share the same underlying array will see those changes.*/

//Slice literals

func main() {
	q := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}

		{5, true},
		{7, true},
		{11, false},
		{13, true},
	}
	fmt.Println(s)
}

/*
Slice defaults

When slicing, you may omit the high or low bounds to use their defaults instead.

The default is zero for the low bound and the length of the slice for the high bound.

For the array

var a [10]int

these slice expressions are equivalent:

a[0:10]
a[:10]
a[0:]
a[:]

/*

Creating a slice with make

Slices can be created with the built-in make function; this is how you create dynamically-sized arrays.
The make function allocates a zeroed array and returns a slice that refers to that array:
a := make([]int, 5)  // len(a)=5
To specify a capacity, pass a third argument to make:
b := make([]int, 0, 5) // len(b)=0, cap(b)=5
b = b[:cap(b)] // len(b)=5, cap(b)=5
b = b[1:]      // len(b)=4, cap(b)=4

Methods
Go does not have classes. However, you can define methods on types.
A method is a function with a special receiver argument.

In this example, the Abs method has a receiver of type Vertex named v

 You can declare a method on non-struct types, too.

/*
Pointer receivers
You can declare methods with pointer receivers.
This means the receiver type has the literal syntax *T for some type T. (Also, T cannot itself be a pointer such as *int.)
For example, the Scale method here is defined on *Vertex.
Methods with pointer receivers can modify the value to which the receiver points (as Scale does here). Since methods often need to modify their receiver, pointer receivers are more common than value receivers.
Try removing the * from the declaration of the Scale function on line 16 and observe how the program's behavior changes.
With a value receiver, the Scale method operates on a copy of the original Vertex value. (This is the same behavior as for any other function argument.) The Scale method must have a pointer receiver to change the Vertex value declared in the main function.

Methods and pointer indirection

Comparing the previous two programs, you might notice that functions with a pointer argument must take a pointer:

var v Vertex
ScaleFunc(v, 5)  // Compile error!
ScaleFunc(&v, 5) // OK
while methods with pointer receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:
var v Vertex
v.Scale(5)  // OK
p := &v
p.Scale(10) // OK
For the statement v.Scale(5), even though v is a value and not a pointer, the method with the pointer receiver is called automatically. That is, as a convenience, Go interprets the statement v.Scale(5) as (&v).Scale(5) since the Scale method has a pointer receiver.
*/

/*

Methods and pointer indirection (2)

The equivalent thing happens in the reverse direction.

Functions that take a value argument must take a value of that specific type:

var v Vertex
fmt.Println(AbsFunc(v))  // OK
fmt.Println(AbsFunc(&v)) // Compile error!

while methods with value receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

var v Vertex
fmt.Println(v.Abs()) // OK
p := &v
fmt.Println(p.Abs()) // OK

In this case, the method call p.Abs() is interpreted as (*p).Abs().

/*
Choosing a value or pointer receiver
There are two reasons to use a pointer receiver.
The first is so that the method can modify the value that its receiver points to.
The second is to avoid copying the value on each method call. This can be more efficient if the receiver is a large struct, for example.
In this example, both Scale and Abs are with receiver type *Vertex, even though the Abs method needn't modify its receiver.
In general, all methods on a given type should have either value or pointer receivers, but not a mixture of both. (We'll see why over the next few pages.)
